# :octocat: Code contribution

You can do this using a GitHub [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) from a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

But before you start, please open an issue about your intention and wait for a project maintainer approve.

After that:

1. Read more about the [developing](DEVELOPING.md) process.
2. Fork the project.
3. Make a new branch from the **dev** branch on your forked project.
4. Open a new Pull Request to the [Seeneva/seeneva-reader-android](https://github.com/Seeneva/seeneva-reader-android) **dev** branch from your branch with pushed changes.
5. :tada:
